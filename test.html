        <div class="cbox_content_txt"> nano  is  a  small,  free  and  friendly  editor  which aims to replace Pico, the default editor
       included in the non-free Pine package.  Rather than just copying Pico's look and feel, nano also
       implements  some missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico, such as "search and replace"
       and "go to line and column number".
